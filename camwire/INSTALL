Camwire installation notes
==========================


Requirements

Camwire needs:

  * Linux kernel 2.4.22 or later.

  * libdc1394 version 0.9.5 CVS (as downloaded from the CVS repository
    at http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=8157) after 11 August 2004,
    or libdc1394 version 1.0 or later.

  * Whatever other libraries libdc1394 needs in turn (libraw1394,
    raw1394, ieee1394, video1394, and ohci1394).  See their
    documentation on http://www.linux1394.org/.

The cammonitor example also needs:

  * SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/index.php).

  * Xv (http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.1/Xv.3.html)

You may use the UNIX `locate' tool to check if and where these libraries
are installed on your system.


Download

You can download the latest Camwire distribution from
http://kauri.auck.irl.cri.nz/~johanns/camwire/distribution/


Compile

Camwire does not (yet) have the usual autotools/configure build.  The
provided Makefiles are examples for use at your own risk.

With luck, the following might work:

  * Copy the camwire-x.x.tar.gz file to a temporary build directory.

  * tar -zxvf camwire-x.x.tar.gz

  * cd camwire-x.x

  * Edit Makefile.common, change the INCS and LDFLAGS variables to where
    your installation of libdc1394 resides, and change the INSTALLDIR
    directory to where you want to install Camwire.

  * make


Install

  * If you have not already done so, edit Makefile.common and change the
    INSTALLDIR directory to where you want to install Camwire.

  * make install

  * [Optional] make clean


Uninstall

  * make uninstall


Troubleshooting

Bear in mind that Camwire is development code.  Any bug reports are much
appreciated.  Having said that, it has worked very nicely for us for
over a year now.

  * Camwire won't compile without SDL and Xv: The Makefiles in the
    various directories can be run on their own.  Only the cammonitor
    example needs SDL and Xv.  Change into the src directory and run
    `make' (or `make library') from there to compile and archive only
    libcamwire_1394.a.  Same for tools/ and examples/camlatency.

  * Make can't find a path to `libdc1394-cvs': You have caught me
    playing with the latest libdc1394 CVS.  Comment out the relevant 3
    lines in Makefile.common and try again.

  * Make reports ".depend: No such file or directory" errors: A hidden
    dependency file is created in each source directory the first time
    make is run. The reported error should be harmless.

  * make install causes "cannot create regular file" errors: My simple
    makefiles do not create directories.  You will have to manually
    mkdir the necessary bin, include/camwire, lib/camwire, and
    etc/camwire directories off the INSTALLDIR.

  * "Permission denied" error messages while installing: You don't have
    sufficient priviledge to create files in the installation directory.
    Try being root if you can, or install it somewhere more local to
    you.

  * Camwire can't find a configuration file when I first run it:
    Carefully read and follow the instructions on the screen.  There are
    configuration files for some of my cameras in the etc/camwire
    directory.  Feel free to add your own.

  * Camwire error messages while everything appears to be normal
    otherwise: You caught me debugging.  Some of the C source files use
    a preprocessor macro called CAMWIRE_DEBUG which causes printing of
    run-time diagnostics.  If you prefer (almost) silent operation then
    remove the -D CAMWIRE_DEBUG option in Makefile.common (and
    re-compile).
